I. GET_INPUT
	- Getting new lines at get_all_lines() with get_next_line().
		* Each extra lines is freed, only returning full_input.
	- Checking the full_input for syntax errors
		* If there's one, full_input is freed and null is returned.
	- If it's empty, just returning null.
	- The full_input (now just input) is returned.

II. TOKENIZE
	- We put a pointer on input to roam it and get tokens.
	- We get new tokens (see next step)
	- We free the original input and return a linked list of tokens.

III. GET_NEXT_TOKENS
	- Each token is lexed and allocated a node into a list of tokens.

IV. SPLIT_COMMAND (;)
	- init_tokens_group() is called
		* Allocating an array of t_tokens lists.
		* Each element of the array is set to NULL.
	- The original list is split regarding semicolumns into
	  the newly created array.
