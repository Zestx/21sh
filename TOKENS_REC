I. This is how the shell should process while tokenizing the user's input.

	1. If EOI (End Of Input) is recognized, the current token is delimited.

	2. If the previous character read was used as part of an operator and the current one can be added to it 
	   to form an operator (and is not quoted), it will be used as part of it.

	3. If the previous character read was used as part of an operator, and the current one cannot be used as part of it,
   	   The current token is delimited.

	4. If the current character is not quoted and is [ \ ], [ ' ] or [ " ], we enter a quoted state. 
	   The token shall NOT be delimited by the end of the quoted field.

	5. (Expansions)

	6. If the current character is not quoted and can be used as the first character of a new operator, 
	   the current token is delimited, and the current character is the first of a new token.

	7. If the current character is an unquoted 'blank', the current token is delimited and the current character is discared.

	8. If the previous character was part of a word, the current character shall be appended to that word.

II. Once tokens are delimited, they are categorized as required by the Shell Grammar.
