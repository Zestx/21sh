- Adding the termcaps code 
  (Robin S.)

- Implementing the builtins functions
  (see how it works in redirections and pipelines...)

- Lots of freeing.. needs to be tested on a Linux VM to valgrind it 
  (valgrind no longer works on Catalina)

- Check for protections and error management everywhere.

- Extensive testing needed 
  (Building an automated test suite would be nice)

- Format the code to the school norm.

	-> By this point, 21sh should be done.
	   42sh implementation can follow.

- See for implementing a proper AST before anything else (priority)
