1. Input Management
	- Getting user inputs
	- Termcaps managements
	- Signals

2. Lexing / Parsing
	- Check if input is empty or only whitespace. If that's the case, continue on new prompt. IN DEV
	- Check if input is unfinished. If that's the case, ask for input again to complete it. DONE
	- Separating input into tokens (commands, quotes, pipes, redirections..)
	- Expanding variables, ...
	- Creating a "chain" for pipes and redirections

3. Execution
	- Creating pipelines with the chains to execute the programs
