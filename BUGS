- when checking for multiple semicolumns one after the other (which is a syntax error), in input.c, 
  it only complain about the error if it's the first semi-column that is concerned.

- when tokenizing a redirection with a file, in the format ">file" only (?), the filename will be preceded
  by the last character of the token before. ( "ls >file" will give 'ls' and '>sfile' )
