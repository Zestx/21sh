- when checking for multiple semicolumns one after the other (which is a syntax error), in input.c, 
  it only complain about the error if it's the first semi-column that is concerned.

- backslash-quoting a space seems to have no effect, it stills create a new token. (this bug also affect
  redirections with a file)

- when tokenizing a redirection with a file, in the format ">file" only (?), the filename will be preceded
  by the last character of the token before. ( "ls >file" will give 'ls' and '>sfile' ) 

- after executing a multiple-nodes pipeline (so just an actual pipeline), 21sh gives back the prompt and segfault
